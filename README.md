# ATM
 
🏦 ATM Machine Simulation Project
This project simulates a functional ATM system that allows users to securely perform basic banking transactions through a command-line interface. The system is built with Python for the frontend and MySQL for backend data handling.

🔧 Features Implemented
🔐 User Authentication:
 Users access their accounts by entering a unique User ID and secure ATM PIN, ensuring confidentiality and security.
💰 Withdrawal Module:
 Enables users to withdraw money from their account with balance validation and real-time update of funds.
💵 Deposit Module:
 Allows users to deposit money into their accounts, with instant update to their balance.
📊 Balance Inquiry:
